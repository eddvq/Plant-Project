# Plant Project

###Future SEO Plan

The primary focus of the website currently helping users find single crop/plant they could potentially plant in their garden. One strategy that to consider implementing would be a dedicated page to blog entries. According to MOZ, a consistent blogging schedule with a targeted plan will help boost ranking and user engagement. These blogs could be about topics that are tangentially related to gardening and would help create a community around the project. If the project does choose to improve its content strategy, it is important that the content is measured to ensure that users are engaging with it and that it is adding value to the site otherwise a different strategy should be considered. With an increase in pages, the pages would have key terms that are relevant to the target demographics in the URLs to improve SEO.

###Current SEO Strategies

The strategies that were implemented in the current build of the page include accessibility and increasing the sites performance. In the previous build of the site the images that were being pulled from Unsplash were at a high resolution which hurt load times, especially in pages with large background images. When simulating a slow internet connection, the main page would take around 5 seconds to load which feels like an eternity.  The images were switched to images that had on lower kb weights which resulted in quicker and snappier load times. To address accessibility, none-decorative images were given alt tags to help users with screen readers consume the content. Additionally, some meta tags were used such as the title and description attribute to help with search results.
